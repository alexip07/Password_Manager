# Password_Manager
Hi!
This is a personal project in wich i made a password manager, i`ve used tkinter for the GUI and the rest is basic python.
It has 2 functions, one for the save and one for the password generating. You will see that every time the mail wil be autocompleted, you can change that to whatever mail you like or you can delete it so it will not pe autofilled(entry_mail.insert(0, "email@gmail.com")) this is the code - line 78.
On the first save it will make an data.txt file where all the info will be stored, you can change the location or the name on the line - 42/43, in the save function, the code from line 44/45 is used for a quality of use, every time a new account is saved the entry points get deleted
I hope you will find this useful.
Thank you for your time, have a great day!
